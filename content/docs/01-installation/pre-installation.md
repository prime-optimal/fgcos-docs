## Pre-Installation
1. Backup all your data such as documents, photos, videos, etc.
   
> **Warning** It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use fgcOS as your main Windows install due to security concerns and the early stages of its development.

2. Download Windows 10 stock ISO 
	- itechtips â‰¤

3. Use Rufus to write the ISO to a flash drive 
	- Plug into USB 3.0 port
4. Create a second partition for fgcOS or better yet, format a new hard drive/SSD.  

> **Tip** You don't need a large amount of storage, a 120gb SSD drive is plenty and even 512GB SSDs can be found on Amazon for ~$25 USD.

5. Copy the Atlas registry file to the USB drive. **This is very important!**  If you skip this part, there will be additional services installed in the background the first time it connects to the internet.
